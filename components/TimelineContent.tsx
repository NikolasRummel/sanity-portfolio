                    I am pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science at DHBW Karlsruhe while simultaneously working at
                    dmTECH. During my studies in the field of computer science at DHBW, I not only acquire solid
                    theoretical knowledge but also have the opportunity to apply it directly in practice at my
                    workplace. This unique combination of theory and practical experience is truly invaluable and allows
                    for comprehensive professional growth.

                    During my 6-month tenure at dmTECH, I actively contributed to Java Springboot and Apache Camel
                    integrations, gaining valuable experience in (REST) API&apos;s, debugging and utilizing Git for
                    version control. Taking the initiative to independently create a service was a rewarding and
                    enjoyable experience. Additionally, I familiarized myself with Scrum and project management
                    methodologies, further enhancing my software engineering skills.
